# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component

## Description
This project is a React app built using Vite. It features a custom `UserProfile` component that displays a fictional user named Julio Gonzalez.  
The component includes:
- A circular profile photo
- A bold name heading
- A short bio/description  

All styling is done with inline CSS to practice React styling techniques.

## What I Learned
- How to initialize a React project with Vite
- The basics of creating and exporting functional components
- Using JSX to structure HTML-like content in React
- How inline styles are applied using JavaScript objects
- The importance of breaking down the UI into smaller components for reusability

## Challenges
While working on this assignment, I had a small challenge aligning the content and adjusting the spacing around the image. I solved this by experimenting with `marginBottom`, `padding`, and `borderRadius`.  
I also double-checked how to correctly insert variables like the name and bio inside JSX using curly braces `{}`.
